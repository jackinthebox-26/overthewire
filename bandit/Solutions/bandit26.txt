Using the vim interface we established in the privious solution we want to find a shell. First we have to set the shell to the right place

:set shell=/bin/bash

Then we can look for a shell

:shell

And now we can use everything normally!

Simply use the bandit27-do and read

./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
