This one is a bit wierd, so you use the ssh to shell into bandit26 with

ssh bandit26@localhost -i bandit26.sshkey 

But before you hit go you make the window really small and then you can upen a vi window with the bandit26 prinout so you can write commands such as

:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

To find the password
